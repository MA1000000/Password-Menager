# Password-Menager
Building a UI Password Manager with JSON File Storage using Python


Introduction:
In this project, I created a graphical user interface (UI) password manager using Python. The goal was to develop a secure and convenient tool that allows users to store website names, associated email addresses, and strong passwords. The data is then saved into a JSON file, providing easy access and retrieval of stored credentials.


Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used for the project.

Tkinter: A Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.

JSON: A lightweight data-interchange format used to store the password manager's data.


Features Implemented:

UI Design: The password manager has an intuitive user interface designed using Tkinter, providing a seamless experience for users to enter and manage their credentials.

Website Name and Email Storage: Users can input the website name and associated email address for each entry, providing an organized storage solution.

Strong Password Generation: The password manager generates strong passwords using specified criteria, such as length, complexity, and character types.

Password Encryption: The passwords are encrypted to ensure the security of sensitive information.

JSON File Storage: The password manager saves the website names, email addresses, and encrypted passwords into a JSON file, enabling easy storage and retrieval of credentials.
